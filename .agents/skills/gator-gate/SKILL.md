# Gator Gate

Validate OpenShell GitHub issues and pull requests for project fit, then monitor valid PRs until they are ready for maintainer approval.

This skill is a gating workflow. It can start from any issue or PR state, inspect the current `gator:*` label, and continue the correct next action.

## Skill Location

Codex and other agent harnesses should load this skill from the repository path `.agents/skills/gator-gate/SKILL.md`. After this branch is merged, the canonical GitHub location is <https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/blob/main/.agents/skills/gator-gate/SKILL.md>.

## Prerequisites

- The `gh` CLI must be able to call GitHub APIs (`gh api user --jq '.login'`)
- You must be in the OpenShell repository root
- GitHub write permissions are required to apply labels, comment, close issues/PRs, or post `/ok to test`

Do not use `gh auth status` as the authentication health check inside provider-backed sandboxes. Scoped provider tokens may be exposed as `openshell:resolve:env:*` placeholders and `gh auth status` probes endpoints outside the gator policy, causing false "token is invalid" reports even when allowed `gh api` and `gh pr` calls succeed. Use `gh api user --jq '.login'` and a repo-scoped probe instead.

Use REST-backed `gh api` for GitHub write actions inside gator sandboxes. Do not rely on `gh issue edit`, `gh pr edit`, or other high-level write commands when a REST path is available, because some of them use GraphQL mutations and gator policy allows GraphQL reads only. Do not fall back to `curl` for credentialed GitHub writes unless the active provider policy explicitly allows the `curl` binary for the same scoped endpoint. Preferred write shapes:

```bash
jq -Rs '{body:.}' comment.md > /tmp/comment.json
gh api --method POST repos/NVIDIA/OpenShell/issues/<number>/comments --input /tmp/comment.json --jq .html_url
gh api --method POST repos/NVIDIA/OpenShell/issues/<number>/labels -f labels[]="gator:<state>"
gh api --method DELETE repos/NVIDIA/OpenShell/issues/<number>/labels/gator%3Ablocked --silent || true
```

If a required GitHub REST read or write fails with `EOF`, `Empty reply from server`, or a sandbox `NET:FAIL` after the current policy shows the endpoint was allowed, treat it as a transient transport or provider failure. Do not convert the PR or issue to `gator:blocked`, do not report it as a rate-limit/auth failure, and do not keep probing optional endpoints such as `/rate_limit`. In supervised watch mode, finish with `OPENSHELL_AGENT_RESULT {"status":"transient_failure","next_poll_seconds":120,"reason":"github_transport_eof"}` so the supervisor retries soon.

## Authority Rules

- Do not push commits to a contributor's PR branch by default.
- You may push changes only when explicitly instructed by a GitHub comment from a maintainer or by a direct operator prompt.
- Do not post `/ok to test <sha>` unless the current GitHub user has maintainer authority.
- Code review is code-only. Do not run pre-commit, unit tests, or E2E locally as part of the initial PR review unless explicitly instructed.
- Security vulnerabilities must not be triaged through public GitHub issues. Follow `SECURITY.md`.

Maintainer authority means one of:

- User is in the NVIDIA `openshell-maintainers` team
- User is a CODEOWNER listed in `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- Repository permission is `admin`, `maintain`, or `write` for maintainer-only actions such as `/ok to test`

Use these checks where needed:

```bash
gh api user --jq '.login'
gh api repos/NVIDIA/OpenShell/collaborators/<user>/permission --jq '{permission,role_name}'
gh api orgs/NVIDIA/teams/openshell-maintainers/members --jq '.[].login'
```

If a permission or team-membership query fails due to API access, fall back to CODEOWNERS and repository permission where possible. If authority cannot be verified, do not perform maintainer-only actions.

## Comment Marker

All comments posted by this skill must begin with this marker:

```markdown
> **gator-agent**
```

Use one canonical gator comment per issue or PR head SHA for baseline state summaries when possible. Edit it only for housekeeping updates that do not respond to new human activity.

When gator is continuing a conversation after a human comment, review, or requested change, post a new marked comment only if the PR head SHA changed or no marked gator comment/review exists for the current head SHA. If a marked gator comment or PR review already exists for the current head SHA, do not post another public comment; record the state in the supervised result sentinel and wait for a new commit, maintainer override, merge, or closure.

## Human Comment Disposition

Every substantive human comment or review after a gator request must be addressed in the next gator action. Do not silently keep the same state when an author, maintainer, or reviewer responds.

The one-comment-per-head-SHA rule is stronger than the human response disposition rule. If the current head SHA already has a marked gator comment or PR review, do not post a same-SHA human response disposition unless a maintainer explicitly asks for a same-SHA public response.

When a human response claims that requested changes were made, re-check the latest head and publicly disposition the response in a new marked comment only when no marked gator comment/review exists for that head SHA:

- If the response resolves the feedback, say it is resolved and move to the next state.
- If the response does not resolve the feedback, explicitly acknowledge the response and list what remains unresolved.
- If the response is ambiguous, ask the minimal clarifying question and keep the appropriate waiting state.

The disposition must mention the relevant human response by author or timestamp when useful, include the current head SHA for PRs, and explain the next expected action. Do not edit the canonical gator comment for this disposition; continue the thread with a new comment only when the current head SHA does not already have a marked gator disposition.

## Labels

There must be at most one `gator:*` label on an issue or PR at any time.

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `gator:follow-up-needed` | Needs submitter or maintainer clarification; 48 business-hour TTL applies |
| `gator:blocked` | Process blocker prevents validation or monitoring from progressing |
| `gator:validated` | Issue is valid and ready for work; no active PR monitoring needed |
| `gator:in-review` | PR is valid and in agent review or author-feedback loop |
| `gator:watch-pipeline` | Review feedback is resolved; CI/CD monitoring is active |
| `gator:approval-needed` | Agent work is complete; maintainer approval or merge decision remains |

If labels are missing and you have permission to create them, create them with clear descriptions. Otherwise report the missing labels to the operator.

```bash
gh label create "gator:follow-up-needed" --description "Gator needs submitter or maintainer follow-up" --color "FBCA04"
gh label create "gator:blocked" --description "Gator is blocked by process or repository gates" --color "BFD4F2"
gh label create "gator:validated" --description "Gator validated this issue as ready for work" --color "0E8A16"
gh label create "gator:in-review" --description "Gator is reviewing or awaiting PR review feedback" --color "1D76DB"
gh label create "gator:watch-pipeline" --description "Gator is monitoring PR CI/CD status" --color "5319E7"
gh label create "gator:approval-needed" --description "Gator completed review; maintainer approval needed" --color "C5DEF5"
```

When changing state, remove all existing `gator:*` labels first, then add the new one.

```bash
for label in gator%3Afollow-up-needed gator%3Ablocked gator%3Avalidated gator%3Ain-review gator%3Awatch-pipeline gator%3Aapproval-needed; do
  gh api --method DELETE repos/NVIDIA/OpenShell/issues/<number>/labels/$label --silent || true
done
gh api --method POST repos/NVIDIA/OpenShell/issues/<number>/labels -f labels[]="gator:<state>"
```

Pull requests are also GitHub issues for label operations, so the REST issue label endpoints are valid for PR labels.

## Invocation Modes

The user may provide:

- A GitHub issue number
- A GitHub PR number
- Both an issue and a PR number
- No number, with an instruction to process untriaged or active gator items

Resolve PRs and issues carefully:

```bash
gh issue view <issue> --json number,title,body,state,author,labels,comments,createdAt,updatedAt,closedAt,url
gh pr view <pr> --json number,title,body,state,author,labels,comments,reviews,closingIssuesReferences,files,isDraft,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,headRefOid,headRefName,baseRefName,mergedAt,closedAt,url
```

For a PR-only input, derive linked issues from `closingIssuesReferences`, PR body references such as `Fixes #123`, and issue comments that mention the PR. If no linked issue exists, validate the PR directly.

## Invocation Scope

Before discovering work, define the invocation target selector and keep every later query within that selector.

- Explicit issue or PR numbers: process only those items, even if a PR is closed or merged.
- "My PRs" or similar operator-owned requests: resolve the current GitHub user with `gh api user --jq '.login'` and process only PRs authored by that login.
- "All active PRs", "all gator-labeled PRs", or repo-wide requests: process across authors only when the operator explicitly asks for repo-wide scope. For write actions across authors, verify maintainer authority first.
- No-number requests that mention untriaged issues: process only the issue set implied by the request, such as open issues with `state:triage-needed`.

For PR watch requests, normal discovery should include open non-draft PRs matching the target selector. Closed/merged reconciliation may also include closed or merged PRs matching the same selector when they still have an active `gator:*` label. This is a cleanup extension of the current invocation scope, not permission to scan or mutate all gator-labeled PRs in the repository.

When searching for closed or merged PRs with active gator labels, query each label separately and de-dupe by PR number. Do not combine labels into one comma-separated search term; GitHub search does not treat that as an OR query and can miss PRs. Example for "my PRs":

```bash
author="$(gh api user --jq '.login')"
for label in \
  gator:follow-up-needed \
  gator:blocked \
  gator:validated \
  gator:in-review \
  gator:watch-pipeline \
  gator:approval-needed; do
  gh pr list --repo NVIDIA/OpenShell --author "$author" --state closed \
    --search "label:$label" \
    --json number,title,state,mergedAt,closedAt,labels,url,updatedAt
done | jq -s 'add | unique_by(.number)'
```

When using closed/merged reconciliation for a PR that was not explicitly requested by number, require a prior comment beginning with `> **gator-agent**` before mutating labels.

If a closed or merged PR has an active `gator:*` label but no gator marker and was not explicitly requested, report the label drift in the cycle summary and leave the labels unchanged.

## State Machine

```text
No gator label
  -> gator:follow-up-needed  missing why, UX path, repro, RFC/roadmap link, or author action
  -> gator:blocked           process blocker prevents progress
  -> gator:validated         issue is valid and ready for work
  -> gator:in-review         PR is valid and enters monitoring
  -> close not planned       invalid or out of project scope

  -> gator:validated         issue clarified and valid
  -> gator:in-review         PR clarified and valid
  -> gator:blocked           process blocker discovered
  -> close not planned       48 business-hour TTL expired

gator:blocked

  -> stay blocked            blocker still present
  -> nudge responsible party blocker unchanged after 48 business hours
  -> stop                    closed by vouch gate; wait for vouch and reopen

  -> gator:in-review         new review feedback or code changes need attention
  -> gator:follow-up-needed  author action needed for failures
  -> gator:blocked           process blocker prevents test execution

  -> stop                    human maintainers take over
  -> nudge maintainers       no maintainer action after 48 business hours
  -> gator:in-review         maintainer requests changes or author updates PR
```

## Step 1: Fetch Context

Fetch issue, PR, comments, reviews, files, labels, and linked references. Also inspect existing gator state.

For PRs, record:

- PR number and URL
- Head SHA from `headRefOid`
- Linked issue numbers
- Draft status
- Merge state
- Review decision
- Changed files and affected subsystems
- Existing `test:*` labels

For issues, record:

- Issue number and URL
- Author and author association where available
- Current labels
- Whether a linked PR exists
- Last human or maintainer comment after any gator follow-up request

## Step 2: Recover From Current State

If exactly one `gator:*` label exists, resume from that state in the state machine.

If multiple `gator:*` labels exist:

1. Treat this as label drift.
2. Read recent comments and labels to infer the most advanced safe state.
3. Comment with the correction.
4. Remove all but the chosen `gator:*` label.

If no `gator:*` label exists, begin validation.

## Closed/Merged PR Reconciliation

Before running normal PR validation, review, CI, or approval logic, check whether each target PR is already closed or merged.

For merged PRs:

1. Post a `Monitoring Complete` comment when the PR still has an active `gator:*` label or the latest gator comment does not already record monitoring completion.
2. Remove all active `gator:*` labels.
3. Do not run duplicate detection, review, CI watch, approval nudges, or other active-state transitions.

For closed-unmerged PRs:

1. Post a `Monitoring Complete` comment when the PR still has an active `gator:*` label or the latest gator comment does not already record monitoring completion.
2. Remove all active `gator:*` labels.
3. Do not run duplicate detection, review, CI watch, approval nudges, or other active-state transitions.

For closed or merged PRs that have no active `gator:*` label and already have a monitoring-complete gator comment, take no GitHub write action.

In supervised watch mode, return `OPENSHELL_AGENT_RESULT {"status":"complete","reason":"pr_merged"}` or `OPENSHELL_AGENT_RESULT {"status":"complete","reason":"pr_closed"}` only when all targeted PRs in the cycle are closed, merged, or otherwise complete. If any targeted PR still needs future reconciliation, return the appropriate `waiting` or `blocked` sentinel for the active work.

## Watch Loop Rules

Every gator state is a watch state. On each invocation, determine the current state, inspect the latest issue/PR activity, and either advance to the next state, keep waiting, or post a TTL nudge.

When `OPENSHELL_AGENT_RUN_MODE=watch`, the OpenShell agent supervisor owns the sleep/relaunch loop. In that mode, perform exactly one reconciliation cycle, do not run `sleep 900` or an unbounded polling loop inside the harness, and finish with a single final-line result sentinel:

```text
OPENSHELL_AGENT_RESULT {"status":"waiting","next_poll_seconds":900,"reason":"checks_pending"}
```

Use `status=waiting` for routine CI/PR activity waits, `status=blocked` for human or process blockers, `status=complete` for closed or merged PRs and other complete items, `status=terminal_failure` for unrecoverable errors, and `status=transient_failure` only when the supervisor should retry soon. The supervisor will sleep and invoke the harness again with fresh GitHub state.

When not running under supervised watch mode, do not stop after a one-shot check when a PR is in an active waiting state unless the operator explicitly asks for a one-shot status check. Enter a polling loop and state the interval and stop conditions before waiting.

Default live-watch cadence:

- For supervised watch mode, set `next_poll_seconds` to 900 for PRs in active states: `gator:in-review`, `gator:watch-pipeline`, `gator:approval-needed`, and `gator:blocked`.
- Watch PRs indefinitely across gator state transitions until they close, merge, or the operator stops the session. In supervised watch mode this means return a `waiting` or `blocked` result sentinel and let the supervisor sleep outside the model session.
- For supervised watch mode, set `next_poll_seconds` to 3600 for issue-only `gator:follow-up-needed` or issue-only `gator:blocked` states until they progress, close, or reach a TTL threshold.
- Stop immediately for issue-only `gator:validated` items that have no associated PR.
- Do not stop PR monitoring just because the gator state changes, a human comments, or new commits arrive. Treat those as triggers to re-evaluate and continue from the new state.
- Stop PR monitoring only when the PR closes, merges, the operator stops the session, or an unrecoverable process blocker prevents further agent action.

Use a concise cycle summary before returning the result sentinel, for example: "No action needed for PR #123; supervisor should recheck in 15 minutes until it closes, merges, or the session is stopped."

Use 48 business hours as the default inactivity threshold for states that are waiting on a person. Business hours are Monday through Friday; do not count Saturday or Sunday.

State-specific monitoring:

- `gator:follow-up-needed`: wait for submitter or maintainer clarification. If no substantive response arrives after 48 business hours, close as not planned or close the PR with a TTL-expired comment.
- `gator:blocked`: re-check the blocker. If resolved, continue to the previous intended state. If still blocked after 48 business hours, nudge the responsible party unless the PR was auto-closed by the vouch system.
- `gator:validated`: for an issue-only item with no associated PR, stop; the issue is ready for work. If an associated PR exists or appears during a later invocation, validate the PR and move it to `gator:in-review`. If new information changes the scope, re-run validation.
- `gator:in-review`: watch for author commits, author responses, review comments, and unresolved gator findings. If feedback is addressed, move to E2E/test-label decision and then `gator:watch-pipeline`. If feedback is unanswered after 48 business hours, nudge the PR author. Continue watching after either action.
- `gator:watch-pipeline`: watch checks until green, failed, or blocked. Move to `gator:approval-needed` only when required checks are green and no review feedback remains. Continue watching after the state transition because maintainer feedback can arrive later.
- `gator:approval-needed`: watch for maintainer approval, merge, closure, new commits, author responses, or maintainer requested changes. If no maintainer action occurs after 48 business hours, nudge maintainers and CODEOWNERS. If humans request changes, move back to `gator:in-review` and continue watching author follow-up.

When calculating a nudge TTL, use the latest relevant event for that state:

- The first comment that entered the current state
- The most recent gator comment in the current state
- The most recent comment or review from the expected actor
- The most recent commit pushed to the PR, when waiting on code changes

Do not post repeated nudges more often than once per 48 business hours for the same state and actor.

## Step 3: Check Process Blockers

Before project-validity review, check blockers.

Move to `gator:blocked` when any of these apply:

- PR is draft and not ready for review
- PR is blocked by the vouch system or was auto-closed for lack of vouch
- DCO is missing or failing
- PR has merge conflicts or `mergeStateStatus` indicates dirty/blocked for conflict reasons
- Required `/ok to test <sha>` is needed and the current user lacks maintainer authority
- Required CI cannot run because the copy-pr mirror is missing or stale and maintainer authority is unavailable

For auto-closed vouch-gate PRs, do not treat the proposal as invalid. Comment only if useful, then stop and wait until the author is vouched and the PR is reopened.

For blocked open PRs, post a concise gator comment that lists the blocker and the exact next human action. On later invocations, re-check the blocker and nudge the responsible party after 48 business hours if it remains unresolved.

## Step 4: Duplicate Detection

For newer issues and PRs, check for duplicates before deciding validity. Duplicate detection is a project-fit input, not a substitute for human judgment.

Search for existing issues and PRs using the title, subsystem labels, changed files, key error strings, and important feature terms:

```bash
gh search issues --repo NVIDIA/OpenShell "<keywords>" --state open --json number,title,state,url,labels,updatedAt
gh search issues --repo NVIDIA/OpenShell "<keywords>" --state closed --json number,title,state,url,labels,updatedAt
gh search prs --repo NVIDIA/OpenShell "<keywords>" --state open --json number,title,state,url,labels,updatedAt
gh search prs --repo NVIDIA/OpenShell "<keywords>" --state closed --json number,title,state,url,labels,updatedAt
```

Treat items as duplicate candidates when they share the same user-visible problem, requested capability, affected subsystem, or implementation approach. Do not rely on title similarity alone.

If a submission is an exact duplicate of an open validated issue or active PR:

1. Comment with the matching issue or PR.
2. Apply `duplicate` if available.
3. Close only when the duplicate relationship is clear and no extra author-specific context is needed.

If a submission appears related but may contain new constraints, reproduction details, or a different use case:

1. Move to `gator:follow-up-needed`.
2. Link the duplicate candidates.
3. Ask the author to explain what is different or whether the older issue/PR covers their need.
4. Flag the candidate duplicate set for human review in the comment.

If a PR duplicates another open PR or implements a feature already being reviewed elsewhere, move to `gator:follow-up-needed` unless a maintainer has already directed both PRs to proceed independently.

## Step 5: Auto-Validation

Auto-validate submissions from maintainers, but still review PR implementations.

Auto-validation applies when the submitter is:

- A CODEOWNER
- In `@NVIDIA/openshell-maintainers`

For maintainer-authored issues without PRs, move to `gator:validated` unless the issue is clearly security-sensitive and belongs outside GitHub.

For maintainer-authored PRs, move to `gator:in-review` and start PR monitoring. Auto-validation means the change is project-valid; it does not mean the implementation is merge-ready.

## Step 6: Validate Issues and PRs

Apply the criteria below in order. If evaluating an issue/PR pair, validate both as one submission but set each object to its appropriate current state:

- Issue without PR: `gator:validated`
- PR with or without linked issue: `gator:in-review`
- Issue linked to a valid active PR: `gator:validated` on the issue and `gator:in-review` on the PR

### Already Validated Issue

If a PR is mapped to an issue that is already valid for the same work, consider the PR project-valid and enter `gator:in-review` unless the PR clearly exceeds the issue scope.

### RFCs

For PRs that add or modify `rfc/**`, validate against `rfc/README.md` and `rfc/0000-template/README.md`:

- RFC lives in `rfc/NNNN-short-name/README.md`
- Front matter includes `authors`, `state`, and `links`
- State is one of `draft`, `review`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `implemented`, `superseded`
- RFC has summary, motivation, non-goals, proposal, implementation plan, risks, alternatives, prior art, and open questions
- RFC is appropriate for cross-cutting, architectural, API, process, or multi-team decisions
- Small bug fixes, small single-component features, docs, dependency updates, and interface-preserving refactors should not use RFCs

Distinguish structural validity from acceptance. A structurally valid RFC PR can enter `gator:in-review`, but implementation work should not be considered ready until the RFC is accepted or an explicit maintainer says otherwise.

### Small Concentrated Work

Validate small and concentrated work when it has clear motivation and one of these shapes:

- One subsystem: gateway, CLI, supervisor, drivers, network proxy, policy, sandbox, TUI, docs, build/release
- Refactor that removes duplicate code or simplifies internals without UX or functional impact
- Logical packaging refactor, such as splitting crates or separating proto/native schema boundaries
- Test improvements for important code paths or features
- Concentrated bug fix with reproducibility steps and a clear test path
- TUI, CLI, or API quality-of-life improvement with a clear user path
- Driver improvement that makes sandbox lifecycle management easier or more efficient
- Documentation clarification, typo fix, errata, or missing documentation
- CI/CD/build/release improvement, including Snap, package, release, or test harness work

Documentation changes from non-maintainers must not reorder ToC items, change fundamental hierarchy, or restructure docs without a clear maintainer-approved reason.

### Provider V2 and Credential Support

Provider V2 work is a supported high-traction area, but require all of the following:

- Clear UX path for how users configure and use the provider feature in OpenShell
- Clear statement of why the change is important
- Clear statement of who will use it
- Security boundary analysis for credential handling
- Explanation of whether secrets remain hidden from the sandbox agent

Provider additions and updates must use providers v2 through provider profiles. Treat any new or modified legacy `ProviderDiscoverySpec` entries as a blocking review finding unless a maintainer explicitly requests the legacy path. Do not ask contributors to update both systems for compatibility; the provider profile is the source of truth for new provider network policy, credentials, discovery, and refresh metadata.

Be skeptical of changes that expose raw credentials to agents or weaken the credential proxy model, even if the user story is clear.

### Large or Cross-Cutting Work

For larger changes that impact multiple subsystems, introduce major architecture changes, or touch high single-digit or double-digit file counts, require at least one:

- Fits an existing `roadmap` issue
- Directly follows an already validated issue or PR
- Has an accepted or actively reviewed RFC for the design
- Has explicit maintainer confirmation in the issue or PR thread

If this evidence is missing, use `gator:follow-up-needed` and ask for roadmap/RFC/linkage or maintainer clarification.

### Follow-Up Triggers

Use `gator:follow-up-needed` when the submission:

- Does not meet validation criteria yet
- Lacks practical demonstration of why the author is submitting it
- Lacks reproduction steps for a bug
- Lacks a clear UX path for a user-facing feature
- Supports a narrow upstream project convenience without showing why OpenShell should own it
- Suggests swapping core OpenShell components for another project's technology without a strong OpenShell-specific reason
- Introduces CLI/API/UX changes that only work for one driver implementation
- Overlaps existing work and needs reconciliation with the linked issue/PR/RFC

When requesting follow-up, ask only for the minimal missing information needed to validate.

### Invalid or Out of Scope

Close as not planned or wontfix when the submission is clearly outside OpenShell's scope, duplicates a resolved decision, weakens a project invariant without acceptable rationale, or remains unvalidated after the follow-up TTL.

Comment before closing and include a concise reason. Apply `wontfix` if appropriate and available.

## Step 7: Follow-Up TTL

When applying `gator:follow-up-needed`, post a comment with:

- What information is missing
- Who needs to respond, usually the original submitter
- That the item may be closed if no author or maintainer response arrives within 48 business hours

Business hours are Monday through Friday. Do not count Saturday or Sunday toward the 48-hour TTL.

Any substantive comment from the original submitter or a maintainer resets the clock. Maintainers may also manually change labels; respect the latest maintainer-applied state.

Bot comments and gator-agent comments do not reset the clock.

If TTL expires:

1. Comment that the TTL elapsed.
2. State that the issue or PR can be reopened or re-run through gator when the missing information is available.
3. Close the issue as not planned or close the PR.

## Step 8: PR Review Loop

When a PR enters `gator:in-review`, run an independent code-only review.

Before running the reviewer or posting any marked gator comment/review, check whether gator has already posted for the current PR head SHA. Search existing issue comments and PR reviews for the gator marker and either `Head SHA: <sha>`, `Head SHA: `<sha>``, or the current `headRefOid` anywhere in the body. Gator may post at most one marked public disposition for a given head SHA.

If the current head SHA already has a marked gator comment or PR review:

- Do not run the reviewer sub-agent again for that SHA.
- Do not post another marked issue comment, `PR Review Status`, `Re-check After ... Update`, CI update, duplicate findings summary, or PR review for that SHA.
- Reuse the latest gator disposition for that SHA internally to decide whether the PR is still waiting on author action, ready for pipeline watch, or blocked.
- For any same-SHA status update, including CI completion, failed checks, human replies, label changes, or maintainer/reviewer comments, do not post a public comment. Record the next state only in the supervised result sentinel.
- Do not post author, maintainer, or blocker nudges for the same SHA. Wait for a new commit, merge, closure, or explicit maintainer override.

Only run a fresh review or post another marked public disposition when the PR head SHA changes, a maintainer explicitly asks gator to re-review or publicly respond on the same SHA, the PR reaches terminal merged/closed cleanup, or the earlier gator attempt failed before posting any marked disposition.

For PRs authored by `dependabot[bot]`, the primary gator responsibility is dependency-update validation, not normal feature review. Do a quick sanity check for suspicious changes outside expected dependency manifests or lockfiles, then ensure the full required test suite runs, including E2E, and watch for breakages caused by the update.

Use the `principal-engineer-reviewer` sub-agent. Include:

- PR title, body, linked issues, labels, and files
- Full diff or enough chunked diff context to review all changes
- Instruction to focus on correctness, regressions, security, maintainability, and missing tests
- Instruction to check whether direct UX changes update the Fern docs under `docs/` and navigation when needed
- Instruction not to rely on local test execution

When running inside the `openshell-agents/gator` sandbox launcher, invoke the reviewer command specified in the sandbox prompt. Use `task.md` for the subagent input. Put the PR metadata, linked issue context, and diff/file context in `task.md`, save the reviewer output, and use it as the independent review result. The main gator process remains responsible for labels, comments, docs gates, and CI monitoring.

Post findings as a gator comment or a GitHub PR review:

- Use inline comments for line-specific defects
- Use a general comment for design concerns, missing tests, or summary feedback
- Do not nitpick style unless it affects maintainability or project conventions

If findings require author changes, remain in `gator:in-review` or move to `gator:follow-up-needed` if the author must clarify the proposal before code review can continue.

For validated PRs with direct user-facing UX changes, require Fern docs updates before moving to `gator:watch-pipeline`. Direct UX changes include CLI commands/flags/output, sandbox behavior visible to users, provider setup flows, gateway configuration fields, TUI screens, published API behavior, policy syntax, installation/packaging behavior, and documented workflows. Accept either relevant updates under `docs/` plus `docs/index.yml` navigation when needed, or a clear maintainer-authored explanation in the PR that docs are intentionally unnecessary. If docs are missing and no explanation exists, treat it as review feedback.

If no blocking findings remain, decide whether E2E labels are needed, then move to `gator:watch-pipeline`.

When resuming a PR already in `gator:in-review`, check whether gator review findings or maintainer review comments are still unanswered. If the PR author has pushed commits, compare the latest commit SHA with the last gator-reviewed SHA; run a fresh review only when the SHA changed. If the PR author replied without pushing a new commit, do not re-review, repost findings, or post a same-SHA disposition; inspect the response internally and wait for a new commit or maintainer override. If CI changes state without a new commit, do not post a same-SHA CI update.

If review feedback is waiting on the PR author for more than 48 business hours, post a single author nudge. Use the latest of these timestamps as the TTL start:

- The gator review comment that requested changes
- The latest maintainer review requesting changes
- The latest gator author-nudge comment
- The latest author commit or author response

Do not move to `gator:watch-pipeline` until review feedback is addressed or explicitly waived by a maintainer.

## Step 9: E2E and Test Label Decision

Apply or recommend `test:*` labels based on changed files and behavior.

Always apply or require `test:e2e` for PRs authored by `dependabot[bot]`. Dependabot PRs must run the full required test suite, including E2E, even when the dependency update appears isolated to manifests or lockfiles.

Use `test:e2e` for changes that affect:

- Sandbox lifecycle
- Gateway/supervisor interaction
- Policy enforcement
- Network proxy behavior
- Provider credential flow
- Docker, Podman, VM, or Kubernetes driver behavior
- Release packaging that needs a runtime smoke test

Use `test:e2e-gpu` for GPU runtime, CDI, CUDA, GPU driver, or GPU policy behavior.

Use `test:e2e-kubernetes` for Kubernetes HA, Helm, Agent Sandbox CRDs, Kubernetes scheduling, namespace, or controller behavior when the Kubernetes-specific suite is needed.

After applying a `test:*` label, read the bot comment that is posted by the E2E Label Help workflow and follow its instructions.

If a mirror is missing or stale and you have maintainer authority, post:

```text
/ok to test <sha>
```

The `/ok to test <sha>` comment must contain only that command. Do not include the `> **gator-agent**` marker, explanations, Markdown fences, or any other text in the same comment.

If you do not have maintainer authority, move to `gator:blocked` and state that a maintainer must post `/ok to test <sha>`.

## Step 10: Pipeline Watch Loop

When in `gator:watch-pipeline`, monitor PR checks and workflow runs.

Use:

```bash
gh pr checks <pr-number>
gh run list --branch <head-branch>
```

Required gates include at least:

- `OpenShell / Branch Checks`
- `OpenShell / Helm Lint`
- `OpenShell / E2E` when `test:e2e` is applied
- `OpenShell / GPU E2E` when `test:e2e-gpu` is applied

If checks are pending, wait a reasonable interval and re-check.

If checks fail:

- Inspect failed logs with `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
- Determine whether the failure is PR-caused, flaky, or infrastructure-related
- If author changes are required, comment and move to `gator:in-review` or `gator:follow-up-needed`
- If maintainer action is required, move to `gator:blocked`
- If explicitly authorized to push fixes, make the minimal fix and continue watching

When all required checks are green and no review feedback remains, move to `gator:approval-needed`.

## Step 11: Approval Needed

When applying `gator:approval-needed`, post a concise handoff comment:

- Validation summary
- Review status
- CI status
- E2E labels and outcomes
- Remaining action: maintainer approval/merge decision

Do not approve or merge unless explicitly instructed and authorized.

When resuming an item already in `gator:approval-needed`, check whether maintainer approval has been waiting for more than 48 business hours since the latest of:

- The first `gator:approval-needed` handoff comment
- The most recent maintainer comment or review
- The most recent gator maintainer-nudge comment

If more than 48 business hours have elapsed, post a single nudge comment tagging `@NVIDIA/openshell-maintainers` and any relevant CODEOWNERS. For PRs, derive relevant CODEOWNERS from `.github/CODEOWNERS` and the changed files; because OpenShell has broad ownership, include the broad owner set when no more specific owner exists.

Do not post repeated nudges more often than once per 48 business hours. If the PR is no longer green, has new review feedback, or has changed materially, move it back to `gator:in-review` instead of nudging.
