# GPU workload images

This directory defines workload test images currently used by the OpenShell GPU
e2e suite.

## Contract

Each workload image must:

- Use the standard OpenShell sandbox base image as its final-stage base or
  ensure that the requirements for a sandbox image are met.
- Provide a manifest command that runs the workload inside the sandbox image.
- Run the same workload as the image default entrypoint for direct
  container-engine validation.
- Require no network access after the image is pulled.
- Print `OPENSHELL_GPU_WORKLOAD_SUCCESS` only when validation succeeds.
- Print `OPENSHELL_GPU_WORKLOAD_FAILURE` and exit non-zero when validation
  fails.
- Be usable as an OpenShell sandbox image when OpenShell invokes the manifest
  command explicitly.

OpenShell sandbox creation replaces the image entrypoint with the supervisor and
does not run the OCI image `CMD`. E2e tests that use these images through
OpenShell run the command from each manifest entry explicitly.

The test harness is manifest-driven. Each workload entry carries:

- `name`
- `image`
- `command`
- `expect`
- `requirements`

## Images

| Source directory | Image name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `smoke-pass` | `gpu-workload-smoke-pass` | Always succeeds and prints the success marker. |
| `smoke-fail` | `gpu-workload-smoke-fail` | Always fails and prints the failure marker. |
| `cuda-basic` | `gpu-workload-cuda-basic` | Runs CUDA `deviceQuery` and `vectorAdd` validation. |

## Build

Build all workload images:

```shell
mise run e2e:workloads:build
```

Build a subset by source directory name:

```shell
OPENSHELL_GPU_WORKLOAD_IMAGES=smoke-pass,smoke-fail \
mise run e2e:workloads:build
```

The build task uses `tasks/scripts/container-engine.sh`. Set
`CONTAINER_ENGINE=docker` or `CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman` to choose an engine
explicitly. When unset, the helper uses its existing auto-detection behavior.

Local tags use the current commit short SHA plus a short fingerprint of the
external build inputs. Dirty local trees append `-dirty`. Set
`OPENSHELL_GPU_WORKLOAD_IMAGE_TAG=<tag>` to override the tag.

The task writes the latest build refs to:

```text
e2e/gpu/images/.build/latest.env
```

The task also writes the local workload manifest used by the Rust e2e runner:

```text
e2e/gpu/images/.build/workloads.yaml
```

That local manifest is created by `mise run e2e:workloads:build`. It contains
the full image reference, command, expected outcome, and requirements for each
selected workload. It also records the external build inputs used to produce
the workload images.

Use the env file in later commands:

```shell
source e2e/gpu/images/.build/latest.env
```

That env file exports `OPENSHELL_E2E_WORKLOAD_MANIFEST` pointing at the local
manifest. The per-image refs remain available as a convenience for direct
container-engine validation.

## Direct Validation

Validate smoke pass:

```shell
docker run --rm "${OPENSHELL_E2E_GPU_SMOKE_PASS_IMAGE}"
```

Validate smoke fail:

```shell
docker run --rm "${OPENSHELL_E2E_GPU_SMOKE_FAIL_IMAGE}"
```

The smoke fail command should exit non-zero and print
`OPENSHELL_GPU_WORKLOAD_FAILURE`.

Validate CUDA with Docker CDI:

```shell
docker run --rm --device nvidia.com/gpu=all \
  "${OPENSHELL_E2E_GPU_CUDA_WORKLOAD_IMAGE}"
```

Use `podman run` with the same `--device nvidia.com/gpu=all` option on hosts
where Podman CDI is configured.

Direct container-engine validation catches image, CDI, CUDA, and host GPU setup
issues before OpenShell sandbox behavior is involved.

## Manifest-Driven Validation

The Rust GPU validation target is:

```shell
cargo test --manifest-path e2e/rust/Cargo.toml --features e2e-docker-gpu --test gpu -- --nocapture
```

The workload validation path reads:

```text
OPENSHELL_E2E_WORKLOAD_MANIFEST
```

When that variable is unset, the runner uses the default local manifest path:

```text
e2e/gpu/images/.build/workloads.yaml
```

If neither path exists, the workload validation test prints a clear skip
message telling you to run:

```shell
mise run e2e:workloads:build
```

or to set `OPENSHELL_E2E_WORKLOAD_MANIFEST` to an external manifest.

Each manifest entry supplies the sandbox image and command. OpenShell runs that
command through `openshell sandbox create --gpu --from <image> -- <command>`.
The test runner iterates all GPU-tagged workload entries and enforces each
entry's declared expectation:

- `expect: pass` requires `OPENSHELL_GPU_WORKLOAD_SUCCESS`
- `expect: fail` requires `OPENSHELL_GPU_WORKLOAD_FAILURE`

The current local manifest includes three workloads:

- `smoke-pass` expected to pass
- `smoke-fail` expected to fail
- `cuda-basic` expected to pass

## External Manifests

External workload catalogs can use the same schema. Point the runner at one
with:

```shell
export OPENSHELL_E2E_WORKLOAD_MANIFEST=/abs/path/to/workloads.yaml
```

That lets alternate workload manifests use the same test runner without
introducing per-workload env vars.
