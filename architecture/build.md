# Build

This page records the stable build, CI, docs, and release architecture. It is
not a command reference. Contributor-facing workflow details live in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CI.md`, and published docs.

## Artifacts

OpenShell builds these main artifacts:

| Artifact | Source |
|---|---|
| Gateway binary | `crates/openshell-server` |
| CLI package and Python SDK | `python/openshell` plus Rust binaries where packaged |
| Gateway container image | `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.gateway` |
| Supervisor container image | `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.supervisor` |
| Helm chart | `deploy/helm/openshell` |
| VM driver/runtime assets | `crates/openshell-driver-vm` |
| Published docs site | `docs/` rendered by Fern config in `fern/` |

Sandbox community images are built outside this repository.

## Build Features

Anonymous telemetry emission is gated behind a default-on `telemetry` Cargo
feature. It is defined in `openshell-core` (where the emission code, HTTP
client, and endpoint live) and forwarded by the binary crates that emit or
collect telemetry: `openshell-server` (gateway), `openshell-sandbox`
(supervisor), and `openshell-driver-vm`. Every crate depends on
`openshell-core` with `default-features = false`, so the binary crate's feature
is the single switch that enables `openshell-core/telemetry` for its build
graph. In-process drivers (`docker`, `kubernetes`, `podman`) inherit the
gateway's setting through feature unification and carry no passthrough.

Building a binary with `--no-default-features` compiles out telemetry entirely:
no endpoint, no telemetry HTTP client, and no emission code. With telemetry
compiled out, `telemetry::enabled()` is always `false` and the `emit_*` helpers
are no-ops, so the data-model types stay available and dependent crates compile
unchanged. The runtime `OPENSHELL_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` switch remains the way to
disable telemetry in a default (telemetry-enabled) build.

## Linux Runtime Environments

OpenShell uses different Linux libc environments for different host artifacts.
The standalone `openshell` CLI is built as a static musl binary so it can run on
a wide range of Linux distributions without depending on the host's glibc. Host
runtime binaries that use the GNU/Linux runtime environment, including
`openshell-gateway` and `openshell-driver-vm`, are GNU-linked and built with a
glibc 2.31 floor.

## Container Builds

The Docker image pipeline is a two-step flow: build the Rust binary natively
for the target architecture, then assemble the container image from the
prebuilt binary. The gateway image is built from `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.gateway`
and the supervisor image from `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.supervisor`. Neither
Dockerfile compiles Rust — both copy a staged binary out of
`deploy/docker/.build/prebuilt-binaries/<arch>/` into the final image.

Binary staging is driven by `tasks/scripts/stage-prebuilt-binaries.sh`. Gateway
binaries use `cargo zigbuild` with GNU targets pinned to glibc 2.31, including
native-architecture builds, so the gateway image, standalone tarballs, and Linux
packages share the same host portability floor. Supervisor binaries remain
static musl and use `cargo zigbuild` when available, including native CPU
architectures, so C dependencies are compiled for the musl target instead of the
host GNU libc target. Local Docker image tasks infer the target architecture from
`DOCKER_PLATFORM` when set, otherwise from the container engine host metadata
with the kernel architecture as the fallback. CI invokes the same staging step
via the `rust-native-build.yml` workflow (per-architecture, per-component) and
uploads the result as an artifact that the image build job downloads back into
the staging directory before running Buildx.

Runtime layout:

- **Gateway**: `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian13:nonroot` base, GNU-linked binary at
  `/usr/local/bin/openshell-gateway`, runs as UID/GID `1000:1000`. Linux GNU
  gateway and VM driver binaries must not reference `GLIBC_*` symbols newer than
  `GLIBC_2.31`; release workflows verify this before publishing artifacts.
- **Supervisor**: `scratch` base, static musl binary at `/openshell-sandbox`.
  Static linkage is required because the image is mounted/extracted into
  sandbox environments (Docker extraction, Podman image volumes, Kubernetes
  init-container copy-self) and cannot rely on a dynamic loader.

Gateway image builds bake the corresponding supervisor image tag into the
gateway binary so Docker sandboxes do not depend on `:latest` by default.
Package formulas also pin Docker supervisor extraction to the matching release
image tag so standalone gateway binaries do not infer image tags from package
versions.
The Homebrew service keeps gateway TLS under the Homebrew state directory but
mirrors Docker sandbox client TLS into `$HOME/.local/state/openshell/homebrew/tls`
at service start, because Docker Desktop bind mounts must use paths visible to
the macOS user's shared home directory.

Local image work should use `mise` tasks rather than direct Docker commands so
the same staging and tagging assumptions are used locally and in CI.

## CI and E2E

Required checks run on GitHub Actions. Workflows that use NVIDIA self-hosted runners trigger from copy-pr-bot mirror branches, so trusted PRs are mirrored into `pull-request/<N>` branches before those workflows run.

The high-level CI model:

1. PR-context gate jobs publish required statuses for the PR head commit.
2. Standard branch checks run from trusted mirror branches.
3. Label-gated E2E, GPU, and Kubernetes checks run from trusted mirror branches.
4. Gate jobs verify that the mirror branch matches the PR head and that the expected non-gate workflow actually ran.
5. Release workflows rebuild and publish binaries, wheels, images, and docs.

See `CI.md` for the contributor workflow and labels.

## Docs Site

Published docs live in `docs/`. Navigation lives in `docs/index.yml`. Fern site
configuration, components, theme assets, and publish settings live in `fern/`.

Use `mise run docs` for strict validation and `mise run docs:serve` for local
preview. PR previews are produced by `.github/workflows/branch-docs.yml` when
Fern credentials are available. Production docs publish from the release tag
workflow.

## Validation Expectations

- Run `mise run pre-commit` before committing.
- Run `mise run test` after code changes.
- Run `mise run e2e` for sandbox, policy, driver, or deployment changes when the
  affected runtime can be exercised.
- Run `mise run ci` before opening a PR when practical.
- Run `mise run docs` when `docs/` or `fern/` changes.

Architecture-only changes should still check links and references because this
directory is used by agents during implementation and review.
