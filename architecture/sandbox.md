# Sandbox

A sandbox is the runtime boundary where agent code executes. It is created by a
compute runtime and managed inside the workload by `openshell-sandbox`, the
sandbox supervisor.

## Runtime Model

Each sandbox workload has two trust levels:

| Process | Role |
|---|---|
| Supervisor | Starts as root inside the workload, prepares isolation, runs the proxy, fetches config, injects credentials, serves the relay socket, and launches child processes. |
| Agent child | Runs as an unprivileged user with filesystem, process, and network restrictions applied. |

The supervisor keeps enough privilege to manage the sandbox, but the agent child
loses that privilege before user code runs.

## Startup Flow

1. The compute runtime starts the workload with sandbox identity, callback
   endpoint, TLS or secret material, image metadata, and initial command.
2. The supervisor loads policy and runtime settings from local files or the
   gateway, depending on mode.
3. It prepares filesystem access, process restrictions, network namespace
   routing, trust stores, provider credential resolution, and inference routes.
4. It starts the policy proxy and local SSH server.
5. It opens a supervisor session back to the gateway for connect, exec, file
   sync, config polling, and log push.
6. It launches the agent command as the restricted sandbox user.

## Isolation Layers

OpenShell uses overlapping controls rather than a single sandbox primitive:

| Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Filesystem policy | Landlock restricts the paths the agent can read or write. |
| Process policy | The child process runs as a non-root user with reduced privileges. |
| Seccomp | Blocks dangerous syscalls, including raw socket paths that bypass the proxy. |
| Network namespace | Forces ordinary agent egress through the local CONNECT proxy. |
| Policy proxy | Evaluates destination, binary identity, TLS/L7 rules, SSRF checks, and inference interception. |

The supervisor may enrich baseline filesystem allowances for runtime-required
paths, such as proxy support files or GPU device paths when a GPU is present.

## Network and Inference

All ordinary agent egress is routed through the sandbox proxy. The proxy
identifies the calling binary, checks trust-on-first-use binary identity, rejects
unsafe internal destinations, and evaluates the active policy.

`https://inference.local` is special. It bypasses OPA network policy and is
handled by the inference interception path:

1. The proxy terminates the local TLS connection with the sandbox CA.
2. It detects known OpenAI, Anthropic, and compatible inference request shapes.
3. It strips caller-supplied credentials and disallowed headers.
4. It forwards through `openshell-router` using the route bundle fetched from
   the gateway.

External inference endpoints that do not use `inference.local` are treated like
ordinary network traffic and must be allowed by policy.

## Credentials

Provider credentials are stored at the gateway and fetched by the supervisor at
runtime. The supervisor injects resolved environment variables into the initial
agent process and SSH child processes. Driver-controlled environment variables
override template values so sandbox images cannot spoof identity, callback, or
relay settings.

Supervisor bootstrap identity is not inherited by agent child processes. When
provider token grants mount a SPIFFE Workload API socket, the socket path must
live under a dedicated directory. Children also enter a private mount namespace
where that socket directory is hidden before privilege drop.

Credential placeholders in proxied HTTP requests can be resolved by the proxy
when policy allows the target endpoint. For GCP providers, a loopback metadata
server inside the network namespace serves placeholders to SDKs that bypass the
proxy (e.g. Go's `cloud.google.com/go/compute/metadata`). Secrets must not be
logged in OCSF or plain tracing output.

Provider profiles can also declare dynamic token grants. For matching HTTP
endpoints, the supervisor obtains a SPIFFE JWT-SVID from the local Workload API,
exchanges it for an OAuth2 access token, caches the token, and injects it as an
`Authorization: Bearer` header before forwarding the request. Token grant
endpoints are HTTPS-only except for loopback and Kubernetes service DNS hosts,
and returned access tokens must be bearer-compatible before they are cached or
injected. Token response lifetimes are capped and cached with an expiry margin
unless a profile supplies an explicit cache TTL override.

## Connect and Logs

The supervisor runs an SSH server on a Unix socket inside the sandbox. The
gateway reaches it through the outbound supervisor relay, not by dialing the
sandbox workload directly. The relay supports:

- Interactive shell sessions.
- Command execution.
- Tar-based file sync.
- Port forwarding where supported by the CLI/TUI surface.

Sandbox logs are emitted locally and can also be pushed back to the gateway.
The local files are the durable record. The gateway push path is a bounded,
best-effort diagnostic stream for CLI/TUI views and can drop or lose records
when the gateway rotates.

The supervisor writes files under `OPENSHELL_LOG_DIR`, defaulting to
`/var/log`. Kubernetes deployments can mount that directory from a shared
volume and attach an operator-owned collector sidecar. Security-relevant
sandbox behavior uses OCSF structured events; internal diagnostics use ordinary
tracing.

## Policy Proposals

When an L4 CONNECT is denied, the proxy emits a `DenialEvent`. The denial
aggregator batches these events and flushes summaries to the gateway every 10
seconds (configurable via `OPENSHELL_DENIAL_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECS`). The gateway
runs them through the mechanistic mapper, which generates a pending
`NetworkPolicyRule` proposal visible under `openshell rule get --status pending`.

L7 denials (HTTP 403 from method/path rules) are intentionally excluded from
mechanistic mapping. L4 denials carry only `host:port`, which a deterministic mapper can handle.
L7 denials carry method, path, query, and body context. The agent loop reads
the structured 403 and authors the narrowest rule. Mechanistically mapping L7
would either over-broaden rules or require path-templating logic that rots
quickly.

## Failure Behavior

- If gateway config polling fails, the sandbox keeps its last-known-good policy.
- If a live policy update is invalid, the supervisor rejects it and keeps the
  current policy.
- Existing raw byte streams are connection scoped. Dynamic policy changes apply
  to new connections or the next parsed HTTP request where the proxy can safely
  re-evaluate.
- If the supervisor relay drops, the sandbox can keep running, but connect and
  exec operations fail until the supervisor registers again.
